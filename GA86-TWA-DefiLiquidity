I have set companies up in Dubai, Singapore and UK and although there are costs involved, typically they are alot cheaper. The other thing i would say is that the proposal is based on $0.40 ADA, at the time of writing this rationale, we are at $0.25 ADA. So I would like to know more about how they intend to fill the gap befoe voting anything other than Abstain."
