    "comment": "After the initial NCL set last year and it being shown how it can be changed as easily as anything else in governance, I would prefer to see a formula hard coded into the parameters for NCL in future, which focuses on a % of remaining Treasury balance for each year or 72 epochs. The 300m NCL for this year is about 50m more than what is expected to come in from Staking reward taxes, so nett Treasury position should drop from 1.63bn to 1.58bn, I also think it would be good for the community to have visibility to a longer term NCL strategy, rather than one year at a time. Possibly allowing for Multi year initiatives to be able to break down and pre-approve larger strategies. We largely went into last year with a 96m ADA Omnibus proposal that was clearly not expected to be finished by end of 2026 and requires further funding request to complete."
